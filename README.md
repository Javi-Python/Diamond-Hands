# Diamond-Hands
Predicting diamond prices with machine learning models. We use and practice stacked models and prediction pipelines

Notebook Structure

1. Training Algos (first attempt at cleaning data and creating algorithms to predict prices)
2. Training Algos 2 (second attempt at cleaning data in a different way)
4. Testing Algos (attempt at testing and making predictions with algos from the first training algorithm)
5. Testing Algs2 (testing algos from training algos 2 and stacked models)
6. Stacked Models (Notebook that uses an ensemble algorithm pipeline to create multi-level models)
