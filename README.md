# Diamond-Hands
Predicting diamond prices with machine learning models.



Notebook Structure

1. Training Algos (first attempt at cleaning data and creating algorithms to predict prices)
2. Training Algos 2 (second attempt at cleaning data in a different way)
4. Testing Algos (attempt at testing and making predictions with algos from the first training algorithm)
5. Testing Algs2 (testing algos from training algos 2 and stacked models)
6. Stacked Models (Notebook that uses an ensemble algorithm pipeline to create multi-level models)
